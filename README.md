# DLF-AIG Metadata Assessment Working Group

**This is the Sandbox or Development site for the DLF AIG Metadata Working Group Website & Toolkit. The Sandbox deploys to https://dlfaigmwgdev.herokuapp.com/ for viewing.**

**See the Live/Production/Current site at http://dlfmetadataassessment.github.io/ and the Repository for the live site at https://github.com/DLFMetadataAssessment/DLFMetadataAssessment.github.io/**

**We decided to create a new repository for this Sandbox (instead of development locally for the site) due to the breaking nature of some of the requested changes in 2017 to our group's output.**

## Intro

This site was developed by the [Digital Library Federation Assessment Interest Group Metadata Assessment Working Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dlf-aig-metadata-assessment-working-group), a.k.a. the DLF Metadata Assessment Working Group.
