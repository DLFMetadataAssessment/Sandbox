# Skillbuilding Resources

## Overview

This list of tutorials and resources is offered to support those who are interested in contributing and collaborating on the site maintenance and improvement. In 2018, one of the goals of the Website Subgroup was to generate a document to encourage self-guided learning for Jekyll, Git, and GitHub. 

Each resource includes a description of its usefulness, applicability to the group's work on this site, or general ease of use. Recommendations and tips are included, as well.
