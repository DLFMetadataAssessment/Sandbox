# Skillbuilding Resources

## Overview

This list of tutorials and resources is offered to support those who are interested in contributing and collaborating on the site maintenance and improvement. One of the 2018 goals of the Website Subgroup is to maintain a document to encourage self-guided learning for Jekyll, Git, and GitHub. 

Each resource includes a description of its usefulness, applicability to the group's work on this site, or general ease of use. Recommendations and tips are included, as well.


## General Introduction to Website and its Structure

### What is Git? What is GitHub?

A very common question! The quote below from [Library Code Year’s GitHub Tutorial](https://github.com/LibraryCodeYearIG/Codeyear-IG-Github-Project/blob/master/Getting%20Started/readme.mdown#what-is-git-what-is-github) explains:

> Git is an open source version control software. Think of it as a way to manage multiple people working on the same project; Git allows them to smartly "merge" changes to avoid conflicts. It also keeps a history of the project, so that you can roll back to a time before an error was introduced.

> GitHub is a cloud-based storage site for git. It is a central place where everyone can download projects, track ongoing issues, and view information. It's not the only such site—Gitorious is another one, for example—but it's very popular and has some nice features.

### What is Jekyll?

Serves as a refresher for those with command-line interface (CLI) experience, but also good way for people to get exposed to and practice using the command line.|

## Skillbuilding: Site Building with Jekyll, GitHub Pages
| Resource | Comments |
|----------|-------|
|[Jekyll 3 on Windows](https://labs.sverrirs.com/jekyll/) | Very through step-by-step guide on how to install Jekyll for Windows machines. Starts with how to install Ruby and goes up through how to configure Jekyll once you’ve got it installed. Works best for Windows 7 & Windows 10 (pre-anniversary) machines. Please note: In testing, [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) was installed to manage gems. The only potential issue in this process may be the absence of instructions on how to use a manager for multiple Rubies. |
|[Building a Site with Jekyll: Getting Started with Jekyll](http://kateefly.github.io/getting-started) | Jekyll walkthrough created for  Code4Lib Midwest 2017. |
|[Tutorial on building a static site](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages) | From the **Programming Historian**: "This lesson is for you if you’d like an entirely free, easy-to-maintain, preservation-friendly, secure website over which you have full control, such as a scholarly blog, project website, or online portfolio. At the end of this lesson, you’ll have a basic live website where you can publish content that other people can visit [...] and you’ll also have some resources to explore if you want to further customize the site." |
|[A Guide to Using Github Pages](https://www.thinkful.com/learn/a-guide-to-using-github-pages/)| From **Thinkful**, "this step-by-step guide gets you up to speed in minutes" using GitHub Pages as a hosting tool. | 
|[Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)|Git Bash refers to the BASH emulation tool that is provided when you install Git on a Windows machine. It provides a way for Windows users to use this Unix based environment instead of the DOS environment that Windows comes with (Command Prompt). This gives users an interface that is the same as what is used in macOS and most Linux systems and lets them follow instructions without having to substitute commands (such as dir for ls and so on). |
