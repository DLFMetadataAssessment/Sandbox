# Skillbuilding Resources

## Overview

This list of tutorials and resources is offered to support those who are interested in contributing and collaborating on the site maintenance and improvement. One of the 2018 goals of the Website Subgroup is to maintain a document to encourage self-guided learning for Jekyll, Git, and GitHub. 

Each resource includes a description of its usefulness, applicability to the group's work on this site, or general ease of use. Recommendations and tips are included, as well.


## General Introduction to Website and its Structure

### What is Git? What is GitHub?

A very common question! The quote below from [Library Code Year’s GitHub Tutorial](https://github.com/LibraryCodeYearIG/Codeyear-IG-Github-Project/blob/master/Getting%20Started/readme.mdown#what-is-git-what-is-github) explains:

> Git is an open source version control software. Think of it as a way to manage multiple people working on the same project; Git allows them to smartly "merge" changes to avoid conflicts. It also keeps a history of the project, so that you can roll back to a time before an error was introduced.

> GitHub is a cloud-based storage site for git. It is a central place where everyone can download projects, track ongoing issues, and view information. It's not the only such site—Gitorious is another one, for example—but it's very popular and has some nice features.

### What is Jekyll?
